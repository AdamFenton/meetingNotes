### Meeting notes - Week of 8th June 2022
---
From clump profiles we can identify 3 main groups of clumps:
- Characteristic clumps with 1st and 2nd cores (blue line)
- Clumps with weak first core (yellow line)
- Clumps with apparently no first core (green line)<br>

#### Cross sections in y of the three different types of clumps
Characteristic| Weak fc | No fc

 <font size="4">The clumps with a weak first core and with no first core at all are more extended with a disc about them.</font>

### Clumps with no first core
---
From the simulations with 1M particles, clumps 3, 4, 11 and 12 show weak or no evidence of a first core. The equation of state parameters are:
Quantity| Value|
:--------:|:------:
rho crit 1  | 5.000E-13
rho crit 2  | 1.581E-11
rho crit 3  | 2.828E-08
$\gamma_{1}$ | 1.667
$\gamma_{2}$ | 1.400
$\gamma_{3}$ | 1.100

I need to plot these clumps with different values on the graph thats shows M,R and L as a function of R.

##### Few things to note here
---
- No clear dependance on EOS?
- Quite a few clumps without first cores (zeros in top two plots)
- Still have obviously discrete values for 2nd core radius
- 3 grouping in second core mass.<br>
##### I am still playing around with this so its not final.

<font size="3">I was playing around by plotting the particles in spherical coords and seeing the spirals develop. Since spirals with constance pitch angle are indicative of gravitational instability (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018ApJ...860L...5F/abstract) I thought it would be cool to see them going from gravitational instability spirals to planet driven ones with pitch angles increasing with radius. The video is quite large so you can view it on the website (http://www.star.uclan.ac.uk/~afenton/Downloads.html)</font>

##### Also been writing some bits in the numerical hydrodynamics chapter, you can see that on overleaf.
